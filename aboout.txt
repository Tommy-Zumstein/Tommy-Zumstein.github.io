Hello, I’m Tommy Zumstein and I’m the Lead Game Designer for Valhalla’s Valliant. I am currently a Senior at Seattle University perusing a bachelor’s degree in computer science. Games are my life blood. Some of my earliest memories are of me and my sibling playing every game we could get our hands on: console games, pc games, board games, but most importantly card games. Valhalla’s Valliant began as a passion project for me to introduce my friends to the fun of playing arena draft in Hearthstone and the on-the-fly deck building of Dominion. However, I wanted to focus on making my game as simple as possible for anyone to pick up. No dice rolls flipping coins or any needless complexity that would get in the way of the most important aspect of any card game, strategy. Currently the game is in no playable form. I am still in the process of designing cards, and plan on completing designing and balancing the game by mid-April 2019. Check back then to see plenty of changes to this site!
